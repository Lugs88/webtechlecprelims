<h1>HTTP</h1>
<p>HTTP is based on a client-server architecture.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Servers - origin server</li>
		<li>Clients also know as (User Agents) - web browsers, web crawlers</li>
	</ul>
<p>In addition, a communication protocol used to access resources on the World Wide Web. Invented by Tim-Berners Lee at CERN in 1989.</p>

<h2>HTTP with its Version History:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>HTTP 0.9(1991)</li>
		<li>HTTP 1.0(RFC 1945, May 1996) - get, header, post</li>
		<li>HTTP 1.1(RFC 2068 Jan 1997; RFC 2616 June 1999), RFC 7230 - 7235(June 2014)</li>
		<li>HTTP 2(RFC 7540 May 2015) - additional mechanism in the transmission of data with header compression that allows multi pleasing which is more enhanced than the previous versions.</li>
	</ul>

<p>HTTP uses a request message. In addition, it is a stateless communications protocol. We have here its functionalities:
	<ul>
		<li>cache control</li>
		<li>content media type(MIME)</li>
		<li>persistent connection - it can be reuse</li>
		<li>request pipelining/multiplexing - can have many request at a time.</li>
		<li>authentication/authorization - talks about the security and identifies if the client can be verified and authorized at the same time.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>HTTP Resource Addressing</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>scheme(http or https)</li>
		<li>authority - domain name(resolved to an IP address DNS), host, post number and user information or authentication credentials.</li>
		<li>path to resource(to resolve relative to the document on the server).</li>
		<li>query - set of key = value pairs use: 
			<ul>
				<li>(&)ampersand</li>
				<li>(?)delimeter</li>
				<li>(>)URL - encoded</li>
			</ul>	
		</li>
		<li>fragment identifier - subsection</li>
	</ul>
<h4>First: Request line:</h4>
<p>Method - Target - HTTP Protocol</p>

<h3>Response Message:</h3>
<h4>First: status line</h4>
<p>Protocol - status code - status(reason phrase)</p>

<h3>Message Header</h3>
<p>3 types:
	<ul>
		<li>General - relate to the characteristics itself</li>
		<li>Entity - characteristics of the body</li>
		<li>Response</li>
	</ul>	
</p>

<h2>Demonstration of Methods</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>content negatiation - an HTTP client</li>
		<li>point of negatiation - accept, decept-encoding</li>
		<li>MIME Type
			<ul>
				<li>plain/html</li>
				<li>value/value - text, application - dependent, audio, image, video</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

<h3>ACCEPT</h3>
<p>The value of accept is what will be rendered.</p>

<h3>ACCEPT-ENCODING</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>fetch compressed format</li>
		<li>ones received it will automatically uncompressed/deflate the date</li>
	</ul>
*note - without the ACCEPT-ENCODING it will fetch the uncompressed data
</p>

<h3>RANGE-REQUEST</h3>
<p>Perform partial content/resource retrieval using:</p>
<h3>ACCEPT-RANGES/RANGE HEADER</h3>
<p>If range not satisfiable, there's an error</p>
<h3>AUTHORIZATION/AUTHENTICATION</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>WebDAV can enable in WAMP, Apache modules</li>
		<li>when you copy it also includes the DESTINATION</li>
	</ul>
*note - without the ACCEPT-ENCODING it will fetch the uncompressed data
</p>

<h2>STANDARD METHOD</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>GET - fetch or simply select requiremen to all servers.</li>
		<li>HEAD - retreive only metadata possibly to validate data</li>
		<li>POST - perform resource, specific processing. In addition, if there is a post, there is a message body and is mostly used in submitting HTML from data.</li>
		<li>PUT - hard to implement</li>
		<li>DELETE - hard to implement</li>
		<li>OPTIONS - tells what you can do</li>
		<li>TRACE - allows the server to re-echo the request</li>
		<li>CONNECT - create a secure connection and establish a tunnel.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>SAFE METHOD</h2>
<p>Like read only, no expected change just simply fetching
	<ul>
		<li>GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h3>Idempotent Methods</h3>
<p>Intended effect on the server of multiple identical request.
	<ul>
		<li>GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h3>Cacheable Methods</h3>
<p>Indicates that the response to a method is allowed to be stored for future use. In addition, it also saves on a bandwidth.
	<ul>
		<li>GET, HEAD, POST</li>
	</ul>
</p>
